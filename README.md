- 👋 Hi, I’m @EBPaz, otherwise known as Eva Pazdera.
  
- 👀 I’m interested in starting a new career in Data Analytics! My background is in Sports Medicine, specifically Athletic Training. I have had lots of
  experience taking care of athletes during their most vulnerable moments - their injuries. Due to this I can handle major projects from start to finish and
  work with all the bumps and hindrances along the way. I've worked with many different types of people in many different roles and levels. In general, as a
  person, I have very good observational skills and I LOVE educating. 
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, SQL, Matplotlib and Tableau in a Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp. I'm learning that I LOVE GEOJson and
  mapping data! I also appreciate taking mounds and mounds of data and turning it into beautiful interactive visualizations for any person to see and understand. 
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to meet other data analysts and pick your brain about what type of career trajectories are possible! This industry is SO large that at
  times I have a hard time seeing how I go from start to my end goal.
